Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

Root: If node is root node.
Leaf: If node is leaf node.
Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.

plus

tree nodes is parents or leaf
parents is root or inner

and use subquery 
and think case when ~ end as NewColumn which is not depend on 1 column, so it can deal with val of P and N

I dont know the reason, but i should use 'Root' after then not "Root"
*/

SELECT 
    N,
    (case 
        when P is null then 'Root'
        when N not in (SELECT distinct P FROM BST WHERE P is not null) then 'Leaf'
        else 'Inner'
     end) as NODETYPE
FROM BST
ORDER BY N;
